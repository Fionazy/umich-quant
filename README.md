# University of Michigan Financial Quant Analytics project

This C++ project is being developed by students in the [Quantitative Finance and Risk Management Master's program](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/quant.html). More information on the program is available [here](https://pbenson.github.io/quant-projects/index.html).

Currently, there are three groups of 3-4 students working on initial versions of this project. The goal will be to eventually merge the projects into a single repository, management by the students.
